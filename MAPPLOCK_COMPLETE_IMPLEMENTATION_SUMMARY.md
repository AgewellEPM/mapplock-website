```

#### 2. **Kiosk Mode Hierarchy**
```
1. Guided Access (Consumer)
   └── Built-in iOS feature, basic restrictions

2. Screen Time (Prosumer)
   └── Family Controls APIs, app/web blocking

3. Autonomous (Professional)
   └── Custom overlay system, advanced detection

4. Single App Mode (Enterprise)
   └── MDM-managed, complete device control
```

#### 3. **Security Architecture**
```
Defense in Depth
